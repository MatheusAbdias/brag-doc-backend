# **My Brag Document**

The brag-doc-backend is a straightforward API designed to function as a personal brag document. This "brag document" serves as a curated collection of significant events, accomplishments, and experiences throughout your career journey. By maintaining a record of these events, especially those relevant to your job or work trajectory, you can effectively showcase your professional growth and contributions.

## Why Choose a Custom API?

While using a simple tool like Notion with a public link could be an option, I decided to build a personalized API from scratch. This choice not only results in a more aesthetically pleasing solution but also demonstrates my capability to learn and adapt to new technologies.

## Technologies

- **Choice of Golang:** Normally, I work with Python and Django, but given my extensive experience with these tools, I wanted to explore something different. I've grown fond of Golang due to its simplicity and static typing.
- **Web Framework [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/):** Leveraging the Gin web framework for building APIs provides a solid foundation for the brag-doc-backend.
- **Migrations with [GolangMigrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate):** I'm using GolangMigrate to handle database migrations efficiently.
- **Enhancing SQL Skills with [SQLC](https://sqlc.dev/):** To further improve my SQL skills, I've chosen to work with SQLC, a tool that generates Golang code from SQL queries.
